## 2. Provider Interface Design

### 2.1 Core Interface Design
The provider abstraction defines a unified contract that all data providers must implement, ensuring consistent behavior across different external data sources.

**Interface Responsibilities:**
- **Authentication Strategy:** Define provider-specific credential handling
- **Data Retrieval Contract:** Standardize data request and response patterns
- **Instrument Compatibility:** Validate and map instruments to provider capabilities
- **Rate Limit Management:** Abstract provider-specific throttling requirements
- **Health Monitoring:** Provide availability and status checking capabilities

**Interface Design Principles:**
- **Uniform API Surface:** All providers expose identical methods regardless of underlying implementation
- **Provider Agnostic:** Client code works with any provider without modification
- **Error Standardization:** Common error types and handling across all providers
- **State Encapsulation:** Each provider manages its own authentication and session state

*Detailed interface implementation available in [Provider Implementation](../lld/03-provider-implementation.md)*

### 2.2 Provider Registry Architecture
The provider registry implements a discovery and factory pattern that enables dynamic provider management and runtime selection.

**Registry Design Patterns:**
- **Service Registry:** Central catalog of available provider implementations
- **Factory Pattern:** On-demand creation of configured provider instances
- **Strategy Selection:** Runtime provider choice based on configuration or instrument requirements
- **Interface Validation:** Ensures all registered providers comply with the abstract interface

**Registry Capabilities:**
- **Dynamic Discovery:** Automatic registration of new provider implementations
- **Configuration Integration:** Provider-specific settings and credential management
- **Availability Tracking:** Real-time status of registered providers
- **Fallback Management:** Ordered provider chains for resilience

**Provider Categories:**
- **Premium Providers:** Subscription-based services with authentication requirements
- **Public Providers:** Free-access APIs with rate limiting
- **Professional Providers:** Trading platform integrations requiring local connections

*Detailed registry implementation available in [Provider Implementation](../lld/03-provider-implementation.md)*

## 3. Provider Architecture Patterns

## 4. Provider Selection Architecture

### 4.1 Factory Pattern Design
The provider factory implements a configuration-driven instantiation pattern that enables dynamic provider selection and management:

**Factory Design Principles:**
- **Configuration-Driven Creation:** Provider selection based on runtime configuration
- **Dependency Injection:** Automatic wiring of provider-specific dependencies
- **Validation Framework:** Configuration and capability validation before instantiation
- **Chain Construction:** Building ordered fallback provider sequences

**Factory Architecture Benefits:**
- **Loose Coupling:** Client code independent of specific provider implementations
- **Runtime Flexibility:** Provider switching without code changes
- **Testability:** Easy injection of mock providers for testing

    Request[Data Request] --> Check{Primary Available?}
    Check -->|Yes| Primary[Use Primary Provider]
    Check -->|No| Fallback1{Fallback 1 Available?}
    
    Primary --> Success{Success?}
    Success -->|Yes| Return[Return Data]
    Success -->|No| Fallback1
    
    Fallback1 -->|Yes| Secondary[Use Fallback Provider]
    Fallback1 -->|No| Fallback2{More Fallbacks?}
    
    Secondary --> Success2{Success?}
    Success2 -->|Yes| Return
    Success2 -->|No| Fallback2
    
    Fallback2 -->|Yes| Fallback1
    Fallback2 -->|No| Fail[Fail Request]
    
    style Primary fill:#e8f5e8
    style Secondary fill:#fff3e0
    style Fail fill:#ffcdd2
```

## 5. Rate Limiting Architecture

### 5.1 Rate Limiting Design Patterns
The rate limiting architecture implements a multi-tiered throttling strategy that adapts to each provider's specific requirements and terms of service:

**Hierarchical Rate Limiting:**
- **Daily Quotas:** Long-term resource allocation for subscription services

- **Real-time Throttling:** Short-term request rate control
- **Concurrent Limits:** Connection and session management

**Rate Limiting Implementation Patterns:**
- **Token Bucket Algorithm:** Smooth rate limiting with burst capability
- **Sliding Window:** Time-based request counting and validation
- **Adaptive Throttling:** Dynamic adjustment based on provider feedback
- **Distributed Limiting:** Multi-instance coordination for rate limits

### 5.2 Provider Rate Limiting Strategies
Different providers require distinct rate limiting approaches based on their business models and technical constraints:

**Subscription-Based Limiting:**
- Fixed daily quotas with hard enforcement
- Request tracking and quota management
- Fair usage policies and overage handling

**Public API Limiting:**
- Generous limits with exponential backoff
- Burst tolerance with gradual throttling
- Graceful degradation under heavy load

**Professional Platform Limiting:**
- Connection-based throttling
- Real-time rate adaptation
- Quality of service prioritization

## 6. Error Handling Architecture

### 6.1 Error Classification Framework
The error handling architecture implements a hierarchical classification system that enables appropriate recovery strategies for different failure modes:

**Error Category Architecture:**
- **Transient Errors:** Temporary failures that can be resolved through retry mechanisms
- **Authentication Errors:** Credential-related failures requiring re-authentication flows
- **Rate Limit Errors:** Quota exhaustion requiring wait-and-retry strategies
- **Permanent Errors:** Unrecoverable failures requiring immediate escalation

**Error Handling Design Patterns:**
- **Circuit Breaker:** Prevent cascading failures through provider circuit breakers
- **Bulkhead:** Isolate provider failures to prevent system-wide impact
- **Timeout:** Bounded waiting to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Fallback:** Graceful degradation through alternative providers

### 6.2 Recovery Architecture Framework
The recovery architecture implements a multi-level strategy that maximizes data acquisition success while maintaining system stability:

**Recovery Strategy Hierarchy:**
- **Local Recovery:** Same-provider retry with backoff strategies
- **Provider Fallback:** Alternative provider selection and switching
- **Graceful Degradation:** Partial success handling and user notification
- **System Protection:** Circuit breakers and resource limits

**Recovery Implementation Patterns:**
- **Exponential Backoff:** Progressive wait times for transient failures
