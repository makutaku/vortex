### Recent Updates (2025-08-05)

**‚úÖ Clean Architecture Implementation Completed:**
- **System Overview**: Updated with Clean Architecture layers and core systems description
- **Component Architecture**: Complete rewrite reflecting Clean Architecture with layer separation, dependency flow, and plugin architecture
- **Data Flow Design**: Reflects modern CLI-driven pipeline with plugin architecture and comprehensive error handling
- **Provider Abstraction**: Plugin-based provider system with registry pattern and dynamic loading
- **Storage Architecture**: Dual CSV/Parquet storage with atomic operations and intelligent deduplication

**üéØ Key Architectural Improvements:**
- **Layer Separation**: Strict Clean Architecture implementation with interface, application, domain, and infrastructure layers
- **Core Systems**: Centralized configuration, correlation tracking, and exception management
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible provider and command system
- **Dependency Inversion**: Clear interface contracts and dependency flow

**üîÑ Remaining Updates Needed:**
- **Security Design**: Update credential management and Docker security patterns
- **Deployment Architecture**: Add comprehensive Docker Compose setup and container orchestration
- **Integration Design**: Document modern external system interfaces and API patterns

## üìã Document Standards

### HLD Content Guidelines

**‚úÖ HLD Documents INCLUDE:**
- **System architecture** and component relationships
- **Design patterns** and architectural principles
- **Interface contracts** and abstractions
- **Quality attributes** (performance, security, scalability)
- **Cross-cutting concerns** and system-wide decisions
- **Mermaid diagrams** for architectural visualization
- **Technology choices** and rationale
- **Integration patterns** between major components

**‚ùå HLD Documents AVOID:**
- Detailed code implementations
- Specific library configurations
- Unit test specifications
- Database schemas and file formats
- Implementation algorithms
- Method-level details

### Architecture Documentation Best Practices

**Focus on "WHAT" and "WHY":**
- What components exist and how they relate
- Why specific architectural decisions were made
- What quality attributes are prioritized
- What patterns solve specific architectural problems

**Use Architectural Patterns:**
- Strategy Pattern for provider abstraction
- Factory Pattern for component creation
- Observer Pattern for event handling
- Repository Pattern for data access

**Diagram Standards:**
- Component diagrams show relationships, not implementations
- Sequence diagrams show high-level message flows
- Deployment diagrams show system topology
- Use consistent styling and notation

### Cross-References
- Use relative links: `[Component Architecture](02-component-architecture.md)`
- Include section anchors: `[Storage Layer](05-storage-architecture.md#storage-layer)`
- Reference PRD requirements: `See [REQ-001](../../requirements/prd/product-requirements.md#req-001)`
- Link to LLD for implementation details: `*Implementation details in [Component Implementation](../lld/01-component-implementation.md)*`

### Architecture Diagrams
- Use Mermaid for simple diagrams
- External tools (draw.io, Lucidchart) for complex diagrams
- Include both source and rendered versions
- Focus on component relationships, not internal structure

### Update Process
- Update HLD when making architectural changes
- Cross-reference related document updates
- Maintain version history and change rationale
- Review impact on dependent LLD documents
