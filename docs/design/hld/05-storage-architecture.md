## 2. Storage Interface Architecture

### 2.1 Abstract Storage Interface Design
The storage interface defines a unified contract for all storage implementations, enabling pluggable backends while maintaining consistent behavior across different storage formats.

**Interface Design Principles:**
- **Format Agnostic:** Common interface abstracts specific file format details
- **CRUD Operations:** Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
- **Metadata Integration:** Built-in metadata tracking and management
- **Dry Run Support:** Testing and validation mode without actual storage operations

**Core Interface Responsibilities:**
- **Data Persistence:** Save and retrieve structured financial data
- **File Management:** List, check existence, and delete stored files
- **Metadata Operations:** Track file statistics and storage information
- **Path Management:** Handle file paths and directory structure
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error reporting across implementations

**Interface Contract:**
All storage implementations must provide:
- Atomic save operations with rollback capability
- DataFrame-based data handling for structured financial data
- Pattern-based file discovery and listing
- Comprehensive metadata tracking
- Directory structure management

*Detailed interface implementation available in [Storage Implementation](../lld/04-storage-implementation.md)*

### 2.2 File Storage Base Architecture
The file storage base class provides common functionality for all file-based storage implementations, implementing shared patterns for atomic operations, directory management, and backup handling.

**Base Class Design Patterns:**
- **Template Method:** Common workflow with format-specific implementations
- **Atomic Operations:** Safe file operations with rollback capabilities
- **Directory Management:** Automatic directory creation and path validation
- **Backup Strategy:** Optional backup creation for data protection

**File Storage Architecture Features:**
- **Atomic Save Operations:** Temporary file staging with atomic moves
- **Backup Management:** Automatic backup creation and cleanup
- **Path Preparation:** Directory creation and validation
- **Metadata Integration:** Automatic metadata tracking and updates
- **Error Recovery:** Rollback capabilities on operation failures

**Common File Operations:**
- **Preparation Phase:** Path validation and directory creation
- **Staging Phase:** Write to temporary files for atomicity
- **Commit Phase:** Atomic move to final location
- **Metadata Phase:** Update tracking information
- **Cleanup Phase:** Remove temporary and backup files

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- **Rollback:** Restore from backup on save failures
- **Cleanup:** Remove temporary files on errors
- **Exception Translation:** Convert low-level errors to storage-specific exceptions
- **State Consistency:** Ensure storage remains in valid state after failures
