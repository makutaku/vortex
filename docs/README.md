- **[Data Requirements](requirements/prd/data-requirements.md)** - Comprehensive data format and quality specifications

### üèóÔ∏è High-Level Design (HLD)
Describes how the system is architected and implemented.

- **[System Overview](design/hld/01-system-overview.md)** - Big picture architecture and system context
- **[Component Architecture](design/hld/02-component-architecture.md)** - Major components and their relationships
- **[Data Flow Design](design/hld/03-data-flow-design.md)** - How data moves through the system
- **[Provider Abstraction](design/hld/04-provider-abstraction.md)** - Data provider interface design
- **[Storage Architecture](design/hld/05-storage-architecture.md)** - Data persistence and retrieval systems
- **[Security Design](design/hld/06-security-design.md)** - Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **[Deployment Architecture](design/hld/07-deployment-architecture.md)** - Container deployment and scaling
- **[Integration Design](design/hld/08-integration-design.md)** - External system interfaces and protocols

### üîß Additional Documentation
