# ADR-004: Clean Architecture Implementation

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-05  
**Deciders:** System Architect, Lead Developer, Senior Engineer  

## Context

The Vortex codebase had grown organically with several structural issues:
- Module duplication (correlation, configuration implementations)
- Scattered business logic across layers
- Tight coupling between external dependencies and core logic
- Inconsistent import paths and dependency relationships
- Mixed concerns within individual modules

These issues were impacting maintainability, testability, and extensibility as the system grew.

## Decision

We will implement Clean Architecture principles with strict layer separation:

### Architecture Layers

1. **Interface Layer** (`vortex/cli/`)
   - User interaction through CLI commands
   - Input validation and output formatting
   - No business logic or external dependencies

2. **Application Layer** (`vortex/services/`)
   - Business use case orchestration
   - Workflow coordination between domain and infrastructure
   - Transaction management and error handling

3. **Domain Layer** (`vortex/models/`)
   - Core business entities (Instrument, Future, Stock, Forex)
   - Business rules and domain logic
   - Independent of external concerns

4. **Infrastructure Layer** (`vortex/infrastructure/`)
   - External integrations (data providers, storage, resilience)
   - Implementation of interfaces defined by inner layers
   - Framework and library dependencies

5. **Core Systems** (`vortex/core/`)
   - Cross-cutting concerns (config, correlation, exceptions)
   - Shared utilities and common functionality
   - Support for all layers

### Key Principles

- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward only
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Abstractions don't depend on details
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one reason to change

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns reduces coupling
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation
- **Extensibility**: New providers/commands can be added without core changes
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated duplication and standardized structure
- **Developer Experience**: Clearer mental model and navigation

### Negative

- **Initial Complexity**: More directories and files to navigate
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand Clean Architecture principles
- **Refactoring Effort**: Significant upfront work to restructure existing code

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality during refactoring
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain 100% unit test pass rate throughout refactoring
- **Risk**: Over-engineering simple operations
  - **Mitigation**: Apply pragmatic approach, avoid unnecessary abstractions
- **Risk**: Team resistance to new structure
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and training sessions

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Systems Consolidation ✅
- Created unified `core/correlation/` system
- Consolidated `core/config/` management
- Eliminated duplicate implementations

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Layer Organization ✅
- Moved providers, storage, resilience to `infrastructure/`
- Updated all import paths consistently
- Maintained plugin registry functionality

### Phase 3: Clean Architecture Compliance ✅
- Verified dependency directions follow Clean Architecture rules
- Updated test imports and mock decorators
- Ensured 100% unit test compatibility (109 passed, 2 skipped)

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates ✅
- Updated High-Level Design documents
- Refreshed component architecture diagrams
- Created this ADR for decision tracking

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Incremental Refactoring**: Gradually improve existing structure
   - Rejected: Would not address fundamental architectural issues

2. **Microservices Architecture**: Split into separate services
   - Rejected: Overkill for current scope and deployment model

3. **Layered Architecture**: Traditional N-tier approach
   - Rejected: Doesn't provide clean separation and testability benefits
